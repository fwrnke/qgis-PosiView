Concepts
==================

PosiView is a plugin that allows to track multiple vehicles and objects.
It accepts position and attitude data usually provided in NMEA-0183 format by devices 
like GPS, USBL systems or other sensors.

Connection to those devices is established by data providers
connecting to network sockets (UDP/TCP) or serial ports. 

To get something up and running just do:

#. Create one or more data provider.
#. Create one or more vehicles and objects and assign a data provider.
#. Start tracking and wait for data.

.. index:: Configuration
 
Configuration
==================

#. Enable PosiView and open configuration dialog.

   .. index:: Provider; creating


#. On Provider page, create and configure providers as needed.

   * Add a new provider first, give it a unique name and select the properties.
   * :doc:`provider`
   * Don't forget to apply the changes.

   .. index:: Vehicles; creating

#. On Vehicle/Object page, create and configure a vehicle as needed.

   * Add a new vehicle first, give it a unique name and set the properties.
   * Select a type. For shape types a template shape can be choosen by right clicking on the shape lineedit. If needed, modify the shape by hand.
     A heading of zero points upward.
   * For shape types set the real world size.
   * Select colors for outline, fill and track color.
   * The Z-value defines the vertical painting order.
   * Select a timeout. When no fix is received within that time, the display in the tracking window turns red. 
     An additional notification is displayed in the messagebar when no fix is received within n times the timout.
   * Assign one ore more data providers. If a provider supplies more then one position, a filter is needed. 
     This could be a beacon id or a string. For AIS provider the filter has to be the MMSI.
   * :doc:`vehicle`
   * Don't forget to apply the changes.

.. index:: Tracking

Tracking
==================

#. Start online tracking. 
#. Open guidance window and select two vehicles/objects to see distances and bearing. A compass is visible if the windows lower edge is pulled down.
   The guidance window allows also to display the position of static targets of a map layer.
   
   Requirements for the targets:
   
   * Layer geometry type is 'POINT' 
   * Layer contains a field 'name'
   * Layer has to be the active (selected) layer. The position display is reset when the active layer changes. The plugin doesn't monitor layer modifications.

#. Left mouse click on the green tracking display with CTRL-key hold down copies the current vehicle position to the clipboard. The position can 
   also be transferred via drag and drop.

.. index:: Recording

Recording
==================

#. Position and bearing of the vehicles and objects can be recorded to a text file. All objects are merged into one file. A new file is created after 10000 lines 
#. On General page of the properties dialog select a path where to store the files.
#. Recording starts manually or automatically on tracking start.
